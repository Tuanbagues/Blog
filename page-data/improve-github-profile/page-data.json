A good GitHub profile behaves as an effective marketing idea in selling yourself to potential clients or employers. I will try to explain all the ins and outs of having a good GitHub profile from my own experience.</p>\n<p>First, I will walk you through my college journey so that you guys can easily relate, then I will try to answer all the related questions and inspirations that can come to your mind.</p>\n<h2>My Journey</h2>\n<p>I am a 2020 graduate who didn’t get the chance to attend the farewell and the convocation. My college started back in 2016 when I had no clue of what I’ll be doing in the next 4 years. I went there like a kora kagaz (blank sheet). I chose Physical Education in +2, so had no clue of what programming is. C, C++, Java &#x26; Python were just fancy creatures to me. As a result, I secured C grade in the C Programming course of 1st Semester. Now you can picturize me as a young dumb kid who has no clue why he chose Computer Science &#x26; Engineering.</p>\n<p>I saw some fancy hostel videos of IIT Bombay FilmMaking Club before joining the college and got excited to join the FilmMaking club. When I joined the club, the dean stopped giving funds. Our club has no camera and no future of course. Then I realized the importance of money. Coming from a low middle class background and an underdeveloped town of Rajasthan, I dropped the fancy idea of pursuing filmmaking. Let’s get some money in the bank first. Just like everybody else, I started learning programming to get an internship. During the 2nd year summer break, I applied to a lot of companies from Internshala. Didn’t get even a single response from the recruiters. I hated the idea of competitive programming and got really scared about cracking interviews without any CP. Desperate, I opened my account on <a href=\"https://freelancer.com\">Freelancer</a> to get any project of any domain. Developed &#x26; hosted a basic portfolio on GitHub pages and after struggling for one week, I closed a deal to design few pages for a website ($3 per page). You can read this whole experience <a href=\"https://dev.to/rahuldkjain/how-i-got-my-first-freelance-project-49c8\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>From here onwards, I didn’t stop exploring. I applied for Eklavya IIT Bombay by completing the animation assignments using <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">three.js</a> , but didn’t make it because of the pointers(grades).</p>\n<p>I participated in all the hackathons organized by college’s programming club and that’s how they went:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>1st Hackathon(2nd Year): Registered only for the free maggi and coffee. No submission</li>\n<li>IBM Watson Hackathon(3rd Year): Registered with my 3 batchmates having strong knowledge and experience. Secured 1st rank. My only contribution was to prepare the documentation.</li>\n<li>Chatbot Hackathon (3rd Year): All India Level Hackathon organized by <a href=\"https://www.swaniti.com/\">Swaniti</a> on HackerEarth. Secured AIR 2. Received an internship offer.</li>\n<li>IBM AI/ML Hackathon(4th Year): Registered with the mindset of winning. More confident this time because of the experience gained from the internship.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was able to secure an on-campus internship offer from <a href=\"https://www.quinbay.com/\">Coviam</a>(now Quinbay). This happened because of the confidence in myself that I can grab the offer without doing any competitive programming. That confidence came only doing projects and exploring things.</p>\n<p>I cracked the on-campus placements while working in Coviam (7th semester) and got the full time offer from <a href=\"https://zolostays.com/\">Zolo</a>.</p>\n<p>Then lockdown happened. All the big plans of hanging out with friends in the last semester went flop.</p>\n<p>I graduated in May 2020 and my joining was from September 2020. The period from May to September was where the magic happened.</p>\n<p>I started learning React.js and became a regular user on twitter. I followed all the famous personalities on tech twitter whom I admire and started reading their tweets on day to day basis.</p>\n<p>On one fine day in the second-last week of May, GitHub launched a new feature of creating your profiles in markdown like <a href=\"https://github.com/rahuldkjain\">this</a>. I saw several developers made some really cool addons like adding github-stats, visitors count etc. <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats\">GitHub Readme Stats</a> developed by <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra\">Anurag Hazra</a> went viral in just couple of days. Then the idea of creating <a href=\"https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator\">GitHub Profile README Generator</a> came to my mind.</p>\n<p>I started working on the MVP(Minimum Viable Product) without even thinking about how good or bad the idea is.</p>\n<p>I coded the project in just 2 days and hosted it on GitHub pages. I started writing articles on how to use the amazing tool to create beautiful GitHub profile READMEs in just a couple of minutes with cool addons. In just couple of weeks, people started noticing and liking the project. I didn’t stop. I cross-linked the repository on various popular articles in the comments on <a href=\"dev.to\">Dev</a>. You can learn more about how to promote your open-source project <a href=\"https://rahuldkjain.github.io/blog/how-github-profile-readme-generator-reached-200+-stars-on-github/\">here</a>. My post on Linkedin about this project gained a lot of tractions and in just couple of weeks, the project had 1000+ stars.</p>\n<p>I didn’t stop.</p>\n<p>I subscribed to free 6 months <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/\">FrontendMasters</a> courses using GitHub pro. Learned “SVG Animations” from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner’s</a> course and wrote few articles about GSAP Animations on my blog and dev[.]to .</p>\n<p>I created an account on Fiverr to sell <code class=\"language-text\">SVG Animations</code>. I researched about this particular keyword on Fiverr and found out a huge potential in the gigs. So I created few gigs and started getting orders.\nFrom charging $10 per animation to $75 per animation, I became a level 2 seller in just couple of months. You can checkout some of my animations <a href=\"https://rahuldkjain-animations.vercel.app/\">here</a></p>\n<p>On a very good day, a client from Sweden reached out to me on Fiverr to create a website for his product (<a href=\"https://dosemedbox.com/\">DoseMedbox</a>) to sell online. I closed the deal, worked for 1.5 months and launched it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t stop.</p>\n<p>I realized that I need to <code class=\"language-text\">surround myself with people who are way better than me</code> to grow rapidly. So here I am working as a Frontend Engineer at CRED who is known for their design, app-dev and marketing.</p>\n<p>Phew! That was a long story isn’t it. Thanks for bearing me.
