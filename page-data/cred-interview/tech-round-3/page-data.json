I really liked the flexibility to schedule the interview as per my choice. I need to brush up my Javascript &#x26; React knowledge, so I took a week time before the round 3.</p>\n<h2>Experience: Tech Round 3</h2>\n<p>I again met an amazing developer at CRED during the interview. It started with a basic introduction &#x26; then he started talking about work and projects at CRED. Interviewer asked me about my expectation in terms of work. Then he asked me introduce myself with what I do, what I like and all. So I opened my <a href=\"https://about.rahuldkjain.vercel.app/\">bio</a> and shared the screen to give him a better picture of myself. I told him about my work at zolo, freelancing, animation, and open-source projects. He asked me about why I want to switch and all.</p>\n<p>Then the actual interview started with a basic machine coding problem in React. The task was to develop a form based web application with input fields like PAN Number, &#x26; Aadhar Number etc. He wanted to test React skills on how I maintain the the states of the input fields. Then he started questioning about optimization aspect of the web-app when there are 10+ input fields.</p>\n<p>When I completed the code, he started asking me the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it good to attach a state to every input field and modify it onChange, when there are 10+ input fields. Answer it in terms of scalability? (✅)</li>\n<li>How to handle forms without states in React? (✅)</li>\n<li>Event Delegation? (✅)</li>\n<li>How to make decision on which framework to use (Gatsby, Next or CRA)(❌)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Cleared the round 3 &#x26; scheduled the cultural fit round.</p>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.interviewbit.com/react-interview-questions/\">React Interview Questions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://javascript.info/\">Javascript Info</a>: To learn and improve javascript fundamentals.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Round 3 at CRED","date":"July 20, 2021","description":"Frontend Developer Role Interview Experience at CRED: Round-3"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cred-interview/tech-round-3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cred-interview/tech-round-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Round 2 at CRED"}},"next":null}}}
